# Chip-8 Emulator

This is yet another [Chip-8][chip-8-wiki] emulator project aimed at emulating
the baseline features of the Chip-8 system from 1977. This project does not
aim to be the fastest, nor the most accurate. Instead, the goal was to
create a simple emulator both in design and maintenance.

## Project Site

If you want to know about the development of this project then follow this URL
\<<https://awkless.github.io/chip-8/>\>, which is a simple GitHub pages website.

## Usage

Perform the following in the terminal:

```
# chip-8 <rom>
```

Where `<rom>` is any proper Chip-8 ROM file that you want to play. This
emulator uses the following key layout as input:

```
1 2 3 4
Q W E R
A S D F
Z X C V
```

which map to these traditional Chip-8 keys:

```
1 2 3 C
4 5 6 D
7 8 9 E
A 0 B F
```

When you load a ROM a new window will pop up so you can play your
Chip-8 game using the keyboard controls labeled above.

## Installation

You will need the following software:

- C99 compliant compiler.
- SDL2 library.
- Git [>= 2.20].
- Posix compliant Make.

After cloning this project, run the following commands at the top level of the
project:

```
# make
# sudo make install
```

You now have the `chip-8` program installed!
