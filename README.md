# Chip-8 Emulator

This is yet another [Chip-8][chip-8-wiki] emulator project aimed at emulating
the baseline features of the Chip-8 system from 1977. This project does not
aim to be the fastest, nor the most accurate. Instead, the goal was to
create a simple emulator both in design and maintenance.
